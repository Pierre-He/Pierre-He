### Hello World, the name's Pierre HE 👋

🤺 About me
-----
A software engineer that was once dreaming of being a professionnal illustrator. Even thought he is not, the artistic eye can still be applied to a website design. This is his chance to safely incorporate passion into a technical field.


🧰 My Tools (still learning !)
-----
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=java,html,css,js,nodejs,cs,python,react,vue,angular,docker,git,figma,latex,arduino,fig&theme=dark)](https://skillicons.dev)
This list can be expanded indefinitely...

📝 My Current Goals
-----
* Be able to create efficient User Interface that incorporate psychology tricks to enhance the User Experience.
* A beautiful front-end is better when it interacts, so the back-end skills are second in the list.
* A portfolio website that host personnal works to bridge my hobbies and Software Engineering career !
